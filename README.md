# Melnitz

[Working title][melnitz].
Sorts the mail and presents it in a dashboard so you can act on it instead of trying to figure out threads on your own.

## Usage

TODO: configuration

## Design

Melnitz will sort your email with a particular focus on JIRA, Crucible, uCern, and uCern Wiki.
There are three sections:

* Personal
* Issues
* Projects
* uCern

### Personal

Personal emails are the ones that Melnitz has no particular rules about.
They are considered "personal", to be handled by you.

TODO: allow customizing of this, with additional rules.

### Issues

Issue emails are those from JIRA and Crucible.
They are grouped by story, the "parent" JIRA issue.
Subtask JIRAs are in the same thread as the story, though they are individually grouped.
The JIRA API is used to sort these by "importance" to you:

1. Issues you are assigned to
2. Issues you have contributed to
3. Issues you have commented on
4. Issues you have reported
5. Issues you have no connection with

It is assumed that Crucible review titles contain the JIRA issue number.

### Projects

Project notation is the project name surrounded by square brackets, e.g. "[provider_portal]".
Emails with a project in the subject are grouped together under this tab.
Those emails are then grouped under each project by the thread they are in, grouping JIRA emails by story as explained above.

### uCern

uCern emails are grouped by thread and uCern Wiki emails by page under this tab.

TODO: rank groups by importance
TODO: does uCern have a Jive API so I can do something similar to JIRA sorting?

## Development

Download the [EWS Java dependency][ewsapi] and extract it to `vendor/lib`.

    mkdir -p vendor/lib
    cp ~/Downloads/EWSJavaAPI_1.2/EWSJavaAPI_1.2.jar vendor/lib/

Install [Maven][maven] to download other dependencies.
Then run the rake task to copy down those dependencies so the scripts can use them.

    rake deps
